# Quests
1. I deployed a contract called SimpleTest to an account with an address of 0x6c0d53c676256e8c. I want you to make a button that, when clicked, sends a transaction to change the number variable from that contract. If you're curious, you can see the contract here: https://flow-view-source.com/testnet/account/0x6c0d53c676256e8c/contract/SimpleTest

2. Immediately after you send the transaction, wait for the transaction to be "Sealed" just like we did today. Then, call a script to read the number from the contract. Console log the result.
