# Quests
1. Create a new smart contract in Cadence that has at least the following two things:
- A variable to hold a value (like a number or a piece of text)
- A function to change that variable

After, deploy that contract to the same testnet account you generated today.

2. Send a screenshot of you reading the variable from your new contract using the Flow CLI

5. Go to https://flow-view-source.com/testnet/. Where it says "Account", paste in the Flow address you generated and click "Go". On the left hand side, you should see your "HelloWorld" contract and your new contract. Isn't it so cool to see them live on Testnet? Then, send the URL to the page.
