1. Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words. You can read this to help you, but you don't have to: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp  
The blockchain is a distributed ledger that contains transactions or information that are grouped together into blocks and is shared to a decentralized network of computer nodes. These blocks are validated by the computer nodes before being added onto the chain with every computer node getting a copy of the new chain of blocks. Once a block is added to the chain it becomes permanent and cannot be changed.

2. Explain what a Smart Contract is. You can read this to help you, but you don't have to: https://www.ibm.com/topics/smart-contracts  
A smart contract is a set of predetermined contidions that once met is executed by the nodes of a blockchain network. The execution is performed as a transaction that is stored on the blockchain once it has been validated. The smart contract only follows the rules that have been specified within it by the participants using it. Therefore, depending on the number of conditons that need to be satisfied, it may be hard to get them right. Once a smart contract is deployed on the blockchain it becomes permanent. 

3. Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.  
Transactions change the state of the blockchain by adding more information onto it. This is because the transactions are stored in the blocks of the blockchain once they are executed. Therefore, transactions have a cost that is paid to the nodes that execute them. The cost varys depending on the complexity of the transaction.
Scripts on the otherhand only view the current state of the blockchain without adding any new information thus have no cost.

4. What is the difference between Testnet and Mainnet? When would you develop on each?  
A testnet is a fake blockchain environment used for developing, testing and debugging applications. It simulates the behaviour of the blockchain however the block do not require real money inorder to be executed. On the otherhand, a mainnet is live and accessible to the public for use. Transactions cost real money and the information that is added is permanently stored on the blockchain.
